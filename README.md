# Best-States

In this project analysis, I have set out to find the best states within the United States to live in. These rankings derive from the best-states.csv dataset provided by the U.S News. In addition, I found a dataset from the World Population Review with the states with lowest cost of living.  I choose 7 different categories with 68 different metrics from the best-states dataset to find out which states are most accommodating for their residents. With over 65,000 people participating in a survey taken over 3 years (2017, 2019, 2021), weights were assigned based on what residents prioritized in these categories in their states. These categories include:
### Health Care - 18.0%
### Education - 18.0%
### Economy - 15.0%
### Opportunity - 12.0%
### Fiscal Stability - 10.0%
### Crime & Corrections - 12.0%
### Natural Environment - 15.0%


## Note
The lower the score of each category, the more this factor was favored between states.

The higher the score, the more residents were not pleased with this factor.
