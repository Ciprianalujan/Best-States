    "##### \tIn this project analysis, I have set out to find the best states within the United States to live in. These rankings derive from the best-states.csv dataset provided by the U.S News. In addition, I  used a dataset from the World Population Review containing the states with these lowest cost of living. This dataset is summarized of 6 different categories combined into a rank.  Eight different categories with 71 different metrics from the best-states dataset were used to find out which states are most accommodating for their residents. With over 65,000 people participating in a survey taken over 3 years (2017, 2019, 2021), weights were assigned based on what residents prioritized in these categories in their states. \n",
    "##### The data obtained from the U.S. News includes the raw values for each state determining the metric-level results. A z- score distribution was used to assess the averages among states for each metric. An index score was created for each metric and state. The state that performed the best was given 100 points while the ladder received none. States that lay between these two were indexed accordingly. After obtaining the index scores for each metric, the average of these scores were used to determine subcategory  scores and again, with those scores, used to determine category scores. \n",
    "##### \tWith these scores, I created a pie graph to display the overall weight each category help.  I then used a function that would add up the scores for each category in each state and then divided this score by 100 to get the overall score for each state. After getting the overall totals for these categories, I then took the mean of weighted cost rank and the weighted totals to get the final overall scores for each state and then sorted these totals. These states with the lowest value rank as the top states. States with a larger value rank further down. With this information I had three questions to ask. \n",
    "##### What are the top 5/ bottom 5 states to live in according to each factor?\n",
    "##### What are the top 5 states to live in overall?\n",
    "##### What are the top 5 states to live in according to the factors I find most important? (Health Care, Education, Crime, and Natural Environment)\n",
